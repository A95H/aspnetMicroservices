Step 1 : init project
	create grpc

Step 2 : create discount proto file in protos folder
Step 3 : set the proto compiler in the file properties and set it to server only
Step 3 : build project > it will generate discountGrpc c# file in this path obj\Debug\net5.0\Protos\DiscountGrpc.cs
Step 4 : create discount service file and inherit from generated grpc class
Step 5 : override methods in discount service to manipulate data and requests
Step 6 : build the project

Step 7 : nav to the client service (Basket.API in our example)
Step 8 : in the client project add new Connected Service (right click > add > Connected Service)
Step 9 : Add Grpc service then select proto file (Discount.Grpc\Protos\discount.proto in our example) and set as client
Setp 10 : build client project (Basket.API)
Step 11 : create service file to communicate with Grpc
Step 12 : use this service in your controller
step 13 : configue dependencies in startup file and connectionStrings in appSettings

//docker
Step 14 : create docker file by clicking on the project and add "Container Orchestrator Support"
Step 15 : modify in docker-compose.override.yml in docker-compose
